<h2 class='post-subheading'>Social media and disconnectivity</h2>
<p>It's an interesting irony that the hyperconnectivity that social media promises causes more disconnectivity than ever. A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the <a href src='http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(17)30016-8/abstract'>correlation between social media use and perceived social isolation in young adults was linear</a>. Social media seems to restrict not only the social sphere but also the public sphere that an individual can reach as well. With more polarized political views and easier filtering of discordant opinions on social media, individuals are more prone to isolate themselves in echo chambers that are comfortable.</p>
<h2 class='post-subheading'>Online dating apps and offline connectivity</h2>
<p>Online dating apps also play an increasingly important role in changing the nature of social interaction but differently from social media. They restrict the space of interaction to 2 individuals who may or may not have romantic interest in developing an affordable online connection into a genuine offline relationship. Creating a new channel of meeting strangers has been proven to introduce random links between social networks. Recent research simulated that these random links can <a href src='https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609091/first-evidence-that-online-dating-is-changing-the-nature-of-society/'>dramatically increase interracial marriage</a>, which is an important aspect of measuring social distance in societies.
</p>
<h2 class='post-subheading'>Merging the two</h2>
<p>So how can we apply the online dating model to create offline social interactions between the social and political isolation that social media created? Can online matchmaking be extended to non-romantic relationships to create genuine connections between larger social and political spheres? People belonging to traditional social clustesr may look externally similar but not be the most compatible. What if we can use software to make new connections--random links--between those that look different but share similar ideas?</p>
<h2 class='post-subheading'>A software solution</h2>
<p>To test this idea, I want to build a system that can cluster and match people based on certain \"internal parameters\" that could make people feel connected to one another, regardless of appearance or background. When a user inputs their interests (e.g. manual tagging, Spotify data, favorite books etc) their overall interests will be vectorized into some n-dimensional space without interference of stereotypes that humans traditionally used to categorize people. Then 4 people with interest similarity above some threshold can be clustered into an online and temporary social circle that are encouraged to meet offline and have a conversation about various topics that they may agree or disagree on. The user will engage in an in-depth and meaningful conversation with 3 strangers that supposedly share some interests but not all. I want to find out of such random and non-romantic connections between strangers is sustainable and desirable, and perhaps even effective at expanding the social and political spheres that social media may have shrunk. The model would take care of much decision-making for the user, thus not inundating them with endless combinations of groups in the entire population they need to form, but rather a limited 3 choices of interesting stranger clusters that they can meet that specific week.</p>
