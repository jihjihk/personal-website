<h2 class='post-subheading'>Social media and disconnectivity</h2>
<p>It's ironic that the hyperconnectivity that social media promises causes more disconnectivity than ever. A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the <a href class=\"intext\" src=\"http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(17)30016-8/abstract\">correlation between social media use and perceived social isolation in young adults was surprisingly linear</a>. Furthermore, social media appears to not only restrict the social sphere but also the public sphere that an individual participates in. Algorithmic sorting of certain news and political views on our news feed has contributed to more polarized political views but less access to discordant opinions on social media. Despite Facebook's continuous denial of it being a news source, Facebook has undoubtedly build more distinct walls around echo chambers that users are more comfortable in.</p>
<h2 class='post-subheading'>Online dating apps and offline connectivity</h2>
<p>Online dating apps also play an increasingly important role in changing the nature of social interaction, but differently from social media. These apps restrict the interaction space to 2 individuals who may have romantic interest in developing an offline relationship. Creating a new channel of meeting strangers this way has been proven to introduce random links between social networks. Recent research simulated that these random links can <a href class=\"intext\" src=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609091/first-evidence-that-online-dating-is-changing-the-nature-of-society/\">dramatically increase interracial marriage</a>, which is an important aspect of measuring social distance in societies.
</p>
<h2 class='post-subheading'>Merging the two</h2>
<p>So how can we apply the online dating model to create offline social interactions that bridge the exact isolation that social media created? Can online matchmaking be extended to non-romantic relationships and create genuine connections between larger social and political spheres? People belonging to traditional social clusters may share external similarities but not be the most compatible. What if we can use software to make new connections--random links--between those that look different but share similar ideas?</p>
<h2 class='post-subheading'>A software solution</h2>
<p>To test this idea, I want to build a system that can cluster and match people based on certain \"internal parameters\" that could make people feel connected to one another, regardless of their appearance or background. When a user inputs some interests (e.g. manual tagging, Spotify data, favorite books etc), they will be vectorized into some n-dimensional space without the stereotypes and arbitrary categories we use to categorize people. Four people with interest similarity above certain threshold will then be clustered into an online and temporary social circle. They will then be notified and encouraged to meet offline and engage in an in-depth and meaningful conversation with 3 strangers that supposedly share some interests but not all. The model would take care of much decision-making for the user, thus not inundating them with endless combinations of groups in the entire population they need to form, but rather a limited 3 choices of interesting stranger clusters that they can meet that specific week.</p>
<h2 class='post-subheading'>Potential Outcome</h2>
<p>By connecting them on a similar ground but also challenging them to explore their differences, this platform may be able to foster a genuine discourse and empathy. Furthermore, I want to find out of such random and non-romantic connections between strangers is sustainable and desirable, and perhaps even effective at expanding the social and political spheres that social media may have shrunk.</p>
