<p>For this project, Gabor, Melinda and I have built a campus safety web app that makes asking for help easy. It is a Node.js based web app that is open to any NYU students to use.</p>

<h2 class='post-subheading'>Problem</h2>
<p>Many college campuses mandate students to take basic safety protocol training to help them understand what safety standards are expected, how to navigate different hazards, and how to ask for help when needed. We also receive these trainings during the first week orientation and First Year Dialogues, but due to certain environmental circumstances, we are not allowed to explicitly receive training on substance abuse.</p>

<p>This ambiguity in the admin's policies and lack of students' knowledge on how to handle these situations can hinder emergency situations from being prevented. Even when incidents happen in the presence of bystanders, they are often not prevented as early as they could be. This could be due to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>delayed or lack of reporting due to fear of retaliation</li>
	<li>not knowing when to intervene (eg. how many drinks are excessive?)</li>
	<li>lack of first aid knowledge</li>
	<li>not having means to call</li>
	<li>not knowing how to call the RA on duty</li>
	<li>unclear if it is  “wrong enough” to call the police, especially when intoxicated</li>
	<li>lack of scalable and uniform solution across campuses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To address these problems, we decided to build a web app that authenticates any NYU student to easily call public safety, residential assistants, or their friends within the website and without a phone. We wanted to differentiate between different levels of dangers and risky situations to lower the barrier of asking for help. We also enabled anonymous reporting to allow any bystander to report the incident without fearing retaliation. Having this as a web app that can easily change authentication details (eg. from NYU Abu Dhabi to Carnegie Mellon) allows it to extend across college campuses.</p>

<h2>Front-end</h2>
<p>The front-end uses pug as a templating engine and Bootstrap and jQuery as auxiliary libraries. The key focus was on making each button as readable and accessible as possible while differentiating between risk of situations by color and text.</p>

<p>The initial landing page after login has one text field that gets the current location and passes it onto /emergency or /danger routes. This location data is received so that </p>

<h2>Back-end</h2>
<p>We used Express.js to create the server. Gabor was in charge of user authentication API using Google email. Using the Twillio API, we pass the location data from the GET request and use to form the text body when sending texts to Public Safety, RAs or friends.</p>

<h3>Emergency</h3>
<p>Emergency is categorized as a high-risk situation that requires immediate help from the public safety. After the location from /home is submitted and initial help is requested via Twillio API text, the user is re-routed to /emergency which also contains a simple incident reporting form. This form is submitted via POST request to ensure as much detail is reserved and reported at the spot.</p>

<h3>Danger</h3>
<p>Danger is categorized as less severe yet potentially risky situation that the user or a bystander would like to de-escalate by asking for the RAs' or friends' help. When the user submits location data and is re-routed to /danger page, the user can specify whom they would like to call and what danger they are in.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>This page includes basic first aid responses for different situations. I got this information from online so they may not be specific to local laws or reporting system. Regardless most details would be useful for first aid.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>This page allows a user to specify which 3 friends they would like to contact when in danger. The form asks for both email and phone number in case a friend doesn't own a local phone number but still can be contacted via email.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>What we have so far is a still a prototype and still has multiple limits. There are multiple assumptions made and to be tested as well.</p>

<h3>Limitations and Improvements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>anonymous reporting may result in subjective or inaccurate victims and offenders</li>
	<li>help not arriving on time</li>
	<li>technical problem failing to deliver help</li>
	<li>indoor navigation API</li>
	<li>tracking public safety's location and proximity in real time</li>
	<li>better mobile responsiveness</li>
	<li>NYUAD specific help and guidelines</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assumptions to test</h3>
<ul>
	<li>anonymous reporting helps with timely reporting?</li>
	<li>a website is be easier to use than a phone</li>
	<li>it is the lack of reporting that escalates a situation</li>
	<li>RAs and friends can adequately address an escalated situation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I am happy with the flow of the app and its potential benefits for the student body. Navigating the differences in personal beliefs and local legal system can be difficult. Rather than turning a blind eye to the situation and only emphasizing abstinence, the admin and the student body can focus on better education and realistic training to prevent serious threats and risks to this community's safety.</p>
