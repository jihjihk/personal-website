<h2>Sprint 2</h2>
<p>After making the <a class='intext' href=\"https://jihjihk.herokuapp.com/projects/week4\">first prototype</a> of mytorch and presenting it to the class, we made some improvements, did more user tests, and implemented even more changes. We wanted to make the app as close to real deployment as possible by reflecting our classmates' opinions and concerns about the app.</p>

<h2>User Feedback</h2>
<p>We tested the app with our classmates on campus. We briefly described what the app was and let them interact with it to see what was and wasn't intuitive. It was very helpful to conduct these tests with people who we never told about mytorch because we were able to learn some crucial lessons about how to improve on the project.</p>

<p>Some of the feedback:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lack of tagline makes the app ambiguous to first time users</li>
	<li>Too much text for the safety tips page</li>
	<li>Button texts (e.g. Public Safety) are not very clear or descriptive</li>
	<li>Form input validation is necessary for certain fields</li>
	<li>More step-by-step guide of first aid tips would be better</li>
	<li>Nav bar button doesn't work on mobile view</li>
	<li>'Settings' is not the best word; perhaps My Contacts?</li>
	<li>Better explanation of the consequences of pressing each button</li>
	<li>What happens if public safety doesn't confirm receiving of the messages?</li>
	<li>Who has access to the incident reports?</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall we learned how important it was to make the purpose of the app as clear as possible from the very first page. We were so used to working on the app that we missed how much information we omitted when editing. The same applied to other text descriptions or wordings that seemed obvious to us but were misinterpreted by first time users. So we understood that this round of improvements should not only included technical updates but also better phrasing of the text.</p>

<h2>Making Improvements</h2>
<p>We decided to log every user feedback we got on to the <a class='intext' href=\"https://github.com/gaborcsapo/mytorch.tech/projects/1\">Github project board</a>. This way Gabor and I could see which problems the other one worked on the past few days and get a sense of the updated features without going through the new committed changes. The key areas we worked on were: </p>

<h4>MongoDB Database</h4>
<p>We now have a configured MongoDB database that stores all users, users' friends contact information and incident reports. Whenever a first time user logs in to the app with their NYU credentials, a new account is created in our database, and they are prompted to input their 3 friends' contact information. This only happens at their first log in, although they can update phone numbers in /contacts page. The database also stores incident reports. It is interesting that a lot of our friends asked about who has access to these reports because often times they could be very sensitive information. Currently, it's just the admins of the heroku app that has access to the stored data, but the question of authority, access and obligation to report is something we will have to discuss and decide on.</p>

<h4>Tagline</h4>
<p>After realizing how important it was to have a clearer description of the app was, we decided to have a clear sentence \"is someone feeling unsafe?\" from the very first login page. We want this to line to convey that 1. we help someone who feels unsafe 2. you can report for yourself or for others. Right below, we also include \"Use mytorch to contact friends, RAs or Public Safety to help you or others.\" to make it clear who they can contact for help and how.</p>

<h4>More Guided and Validated Form Inputs</h4>
<p>We split up the form input from 1 text field for location to 4 fields for building number, residential building number, location description, and situation. By having a dropdown menu of the locations as well as helper texts, we guide the user to generate a more structured data about where they are. We also added a Situation form that asks for why the person feels unsafe. These fields are made mandatory using <a class='intext' href=\"https://validatejs.org/\">validate.js</a> validation library. We also added \"Who to Contact\" line to make it clearer that users will be contacting following people for help when they press corresponding buttons.</p>

<h4>Pop-up Boxes for Confirmation</h4>
<p>We added pop-up boxes in case someone pressed the wrong button or doesn't understand when to call whom. Before we had text box below buttons that explained different situations to call either public safety or RAs but we got some feedback that this wasn't as helpful so pop-up made more sense.</p>

<h4>Safety Tips</h4>
<p>We tried to make the safety tips and information easier to read by separating them into three divs and toggling each only when the corresponding button is clicked. We are yet to include UAE specific information but definitely want to improve on it with more pictures and region-specific information.</p>

<h4>Documentation, Bugs and Other Changes</h4>
<p>We also added relatively comprehensive documentation and README to open up to the community. We also want to speak to admin and relevant university offices so we thought having a well documented repository would be very helpful. We also fixed minor bugs and made other changes to improve the overall app.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>The more we work on this, the more there seems to do, but we are very happy with the overall progress. After having presented in the Mashups class, most of our classmates said that they would definitely use this app. We want to continue the conversation going with admin and student life office to get some funding (eg paying for API and hosting services) while opening up to the community to make improvements that we didn't think of or didn't know how to approach. For example, someone suggested that we should integrate with the Facebook messaging API to instantly message our friends on Facebook instead of trying to call them, since most of us don't have working phone numbers or know others' phone numbers. These new suggestions and advices were added to the <a class='intext' href=\"https://github.com/gaborcsapo/mytorch.tech/projects/1\">Github project board</a> so we can keep track of them and continue working on them.</p>

<p>There are some questions beyond technical issues that we still need to answer. For example, the question of who gets access to the incident report data is something we need to discuss and get agreements from the NYUAD community. We might need to include a user agreement box, for example, to make sure that everyone understands who gets access to what data on this app.</p>

<p>Another important decision to make is how we become liable when help is requested but it's not delivered. One way we thought of was having the Public Safety respond to the sent text message with a simple Yes or No and then we can notify the user about the status in real-time. Because Twilio doesn't provide local UAE numbers as server numbers, we have to configure a way to allow public safety, RAs or user's friends to send international texts to the number. This leads to another problem of having two incidents reported at the same time and not being able to discriminate between which incident Public Safety responded to. We thought we could include a URL that can be clicked on to confirm help being sent for a specific incident, but this doesn't account for cases in which Public Safety or RAs don't have smartphones. (In fact, the RA phone is the basic phone that only supports call and text.)</p>

<p>We will hopefully meet with university offices to see what they think about our progress and how they can help us move forward. We will also try to gauge the student body's interests and get help in any way they would like to contribute in.</p>
